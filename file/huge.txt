For an agent in the environment, the main challenge is its initial ignorance of the conﬁguration
of the environment; overcoming this ignorance seems to require logical reasoning.
In most instances of the wumpus world, it is possible for the agent to retrieve the gold safely.
Occasionally, the agent must choose between going home empty-handed and risking death to
ﬁnd the gold. About 21% of the environments are utterly unfair, because the gold is in a pit
or surrounded by pits.
Let us watch a knowledge-based wumpus agent exploring the environment shown in
Figure 7.2. We use an informal knowledge representation language consisting of writing
down symbols in a grid (as in Figures 7.3 and 7.4).
The agent’s initial knowledge base contains the rules of the environment, as described
previously; in particular, it knows that it is in [1,1] and that [1,1] is a safe square; we denote
that with an “A” and “OK,” respectively, in square [1,1].
The ﬁrst percept is from which the agent can conclude
that its neighboring squares, [1,2] and [2,1], are free of dangers—they are OK. Figure
7.3(a) shows the agent’s state of knowledge at this point.
A cautious agent will move only into a square that it knows to be OK. Let us suppose
the agent decides to move forward to [2,1]. The agent perceives a breeze (denoted by “B”) in
[2,1], so there must be a pit in a neighboring square. The pit cannot be in [1,1], by the rules of
the game, so there must be a pit in [2,2] or [3,1] or both. The notation “P?” in Figure 7.3(b)
indicates a possible pit in those squares. At this point, there is only one known square that is
OK and that has not yet been visited. So the prudent agent will turn around, go back to [1,1],
and then proceed to [1,2].
